# Kaggle Datasets

Hello there! 

In this page I am focusing on the machine learning applications over Kaggle datasets and competitions. These markdown files can work as a class notebook since they are spread over entrance and intermediate level techniques. 

## Mushrooms Dataset

The original dataset can be found in here;
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification shared by UCI Machine Learning under the Creative Commons 0: Public Domain License. 

Our main aim in this notebook to cover a basic approach to the machine learning. Notebook contains basic tidymodels mechanics, including workflows, recipes and model setting. Since the dataset is extremely well presented accuracy results are high over a test set. Any model improvement such as grid search and comparison of different models are not available due to accuracy rate.

## Hepatitis C Dataset

The original dataset can be found in here;

Our main aim in this notebook to cover basic grid search, application of pca methods and demonstrating a good explanatory data analysis.
